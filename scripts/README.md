* [ModelToFacts.ipynb](https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/FewShotLearningEfficiency-replication-package/blob/main/scripts/ModelToFacts.ipynb): converts the designed solutions of each participant from .metamodel files into facts for later analysis.
* [plotFormsResults.ipynb](https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/FewShotLearningEfficiency-replication-package/blob/main/scripts/plotFormsResults.ipynb): serves to plot  the results of the questionnaire that each participant completed after finishing the tasks (RQ5).
* [logs-to-Dataframes.ipynb](https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/FewShotLearningEfficiency-replication-package/blob/main/scripts/logs_to_Dataframes.ipynb): generates dataframes capturing the tracked behavior of each participant during the design process from log files.
* [SimilarityCheck_Normalised.ipynb](https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/FewShotLearningEfficiency-replication-package/blob/main/scripts/SimilarityCheck_Normalised(Matrices).ipynb): Generates similarity matrices between all solutions for each assistance mode, based on manual matching.
* [Participant_preference_analysis_FreeTask.ipynb
](https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/FewShotLearningEfficiency-replication-package/blob/main/scripts/Participant_preference_analysis_FreeTask.ipynb): generates plots from the free task to analyze participants' preferences regarding the assistance modes used.
